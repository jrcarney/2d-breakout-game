## Lesson one: HTML structure and Canvas basics
In this lesson we covered the basic strucutre of the HTML we will use for our game, and the basics on how to use the Canvas element.


### The game HTML
- [ ] We started off creating a boileplate html document
- [ ] We then created the `<canvas>` element for which we can draw graphics to
- [ ] Gave the canvas an ID so we can reference it in our javascript
- [ ] Added a width and height to the canvas
- [ ] Added `<script>` tags for our canvas logic to reside in

### Canvas basics
- [ ] We stored a reference to our canvas ID in a variable called `canvas`
- [ ] Then we used our canvas object to invoke a 2D rendering context and store it in a variable called `ctx`
- [ ] We then learned the basics of using `ctx` rendinering context:
 - [ ] - Begin drawing to the canvas by 'beginning a path'
 - [ ] - Created a rectangle
 - [ ] - Defined our rectangle colour
 - [ ] - Added colour to the rectangle
 - [ ] - Stopped drawing to the canvas
- [ ] We also drew a circle with the `arc()` method
- [ ] And also drew a transparent/stroked rectangle with the`stroke()` method
